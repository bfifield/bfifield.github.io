Hello! I am a data scientist in the Legal Analytics group at the American Civil Liberties Union, where I support the ACLUâ€™s litigation and advocacy around redistricting, voting rights, and civil rights more broadly. You can read about some of my work at the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/report/racial-justice-demands-every-vote-counted).

I received my PhD from the Department of Politics at Princeton University after defending my dissertation in November 2018, where I studied statistical and social science methodology with applications in legislative redistricting, electoral politics, and political targeting. My research has been published in the _American Political Science Review_, the _Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics_, and _Statistics and Public Policy_, and my contributions to statistical software have been [recognized by the Society for Political Methodology](https://polmeth.org/news/2021-statistical-software-award). 

From December 2018 through May 2020, I was a research scientist with the Demography and Survey Science group at Facebook, where I worked on causal inference issues with survey data. From September 2015 through November 2016, I was a data scientist in the Analytics team at Hillary for America, while on leave from graduate school. I have consulted for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on their 2018 remedial redistricting, and I am an affiliated researcher at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, where I am also a member of the [ALARM (Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology) Project](https://alarm-redist.github.io/). Prior to graduate school, I was a researcher at the Democratic National Committee.

You can find my publications and working papers on my [research page](/research/), and my Github page can be viewed [here](https://github.com/bfifield). Most importantly, my dog's Instagram page can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/handsomecharliepup/).
