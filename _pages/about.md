Hello! I am a data scientist in the Legal Analytics group at the American Civil Liberties Union, where I support the ACLUâ€™s litigation and advocacy around the 2020 Census and redistricting cycle. I received my PhD from the Department of Politics at Princeton University after defending my dissertation in November 2018, where I studied statistical and social science methodology with applications in legislative redistricting, electoral politics, and political targeting. My research has been published in the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, and Statistics and Public Policy. You can read more about some of my work at the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/report/racial-justice-demands-every-vote-counted).

From December 2018 through May 2020, I was a research scientist with the Demography and Survey Science group at Facebook, where I worked on causal inference issues with survey data. From September 2015 through November 2016, I was on leave from graduate school working as a data scientist in the Analytics team at Hillary for America. I have also consulted for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on their 2018 remedial redistricting, and I am an affiliated researcher at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. 

Prior to graduate school, I was a researcher at the Democratic National Committee. You can find my publications and working papers on my research page, and my Github page can be viewed here. Most importantly, my dog's Instagram page can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/handsomecharliepup/).
