Legislative redistricting is a critical element of representative
democracy. A number of political scientists have used simulation
methods to sample redistricting plans under various constraints in
order to assess their impact on partisanship and other aspects of
representation. However, while many optimization algorithms have been
proposed, surprisingly few simulation methods exist in the published
scholarship. Furthermore, the standard algorithm has no theoretical
justification, scales poorly, and is unable to incorporate fundamental
constraints required by redistricting processes in the real world. To
fill this gap, we formulate redistricting as a graph-cut problem and
for the first time in the literature propose a new automated
redistricting simulator based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. The
proposed algorithm can incorporate contiguity and equal population
constraints at the same time. We apply simulated and parallel
tempering to improve the mixing of the resulting Markov chain. Through
a small-scale validation study, we show that the proposed algorithm
can approximate a target distribution more accurately than the
standard algorithm. We also apply the proposed methodology to data
from Pennsylvania to demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to
real-world redistricting problems. The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/redist/">open-source software</a> is available for implementing the proposed methodology.
